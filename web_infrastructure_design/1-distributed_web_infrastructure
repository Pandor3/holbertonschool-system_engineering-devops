Additional Elements :
- Load Balancer
- A second Server

The Load Balancer is used in order to not overload the servers with an overwhelming number of queries, it shares the number of queries between the two servers.
The Second Server is used in order to increase the number of queries that a user (or users) can send before the server starts to have problems, even if that is the case, the load balancer helps with sharing out the various queries which can be sent by the various users.

Since our load balancer uses the round robin system, it means that our load balancer has a static algorithm.

Requests are distributed sequentially across the server pool
Each server receives requests in turn
Example: Server1 -> Server2 -> Server1 -> Server2


Setup: Active-Active

Both servers actively handle requests simultaneously
Differs from Active-Passive where the second server only activates if the first fails
Better resource utilization but requires more coordination


Multiple Servers

-Eliminates SPOF for web/application servers
-Allows for load distribution
Each server contains:

- Web server (Nginx)
- Application server
- Application files


Database Primary-Replica Cluster

Primary Node (Master):

It will: - Handle all write operations
- Maintain authoritative dataset
- Replicates data to replica node
- Only database that can accept writes from the application


Replica Node (Slave):

It will : - Handle read operations
- Can be promoted to primary if needed
- Reduces read load on primary node


How Replication Works:

- Primary records all changes in binary log
- Replica copies binary log
- Replica applies changes to stay synchronized
- Asynchronous replication by default


Infrastructure Issues
Single Points of Failure (SPOF)

Load balancer is a SPOF
Database Primary node is a SPOF

Security Issues

No firewall implemented
No HTTPS encryption

Data transmitted in plain text
Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks


No network segmentation

Monitoring Limitations

No monitoring solutions implemented
Cannot track:

- Server health
- Resource utilization
- Application performance
- Security threats
- Response times


No alerting system for issues
No performance metrics collection

Infrastructure Improvement Suggestions

- Implement firewalls
- Set up monitoring system
- Implement automated backups
